# Python Basics with NumPy 

This repository contains my programming assignment from **Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning** (Week 2) of the **Deep Learning Specialization** by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

##  Description

The assignment focuses on:
- Core Python programming relevant for deep learning
- Broadcasting and vectorization with NumPy
- Efficient computation using NumPy arrays
- Avoiding explicit loops in favor of matrix operations

This foundational assignment sets the stage for building and training deep neural networks efficiently.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (for assignment environment)

##  Files

- `python_basics_with_numpy.ipynb`: The main assignment notebook with implemented solutions
- `testCases_v2.py`: Helper functions provided for testing
- `public_tests.py`: Public test cases for validation

> âš  Note: This repository includes **only my own implementations** and avoids sharing full course solutions that may violate Coursera's Honor Code.
